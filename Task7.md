## Task 7 - Finale - (Vulnerability Research, Exploitation)

> Now that we have access to the hidden channel the adversary is using, our military counterparts want to act quickly to destroy the adversary's capacity to continue with their attack against our military networks.

> Analysts have been quickly scrutinizing the data from the privileged channel. They conclude that the adversary has downloaded a custom app to archive all messages sent in the channel locally to their phone. They have also surmised the adversary is running a recent version of Android on a Google Pixel phone. This is the opportunity we have been waiting for! If we can devise a way to exploit on to the adversary's device we will have the advantage.

> Another team has retrieved the custom application APK file for you to analyze.

> Downloads: Custom App (mmarchiver.apk), Licenses (licenses.txt)

> Prompt: Submit a file to be posted to the Mattermost Channel that will be processed by the app and exploits the device. Be careful, we might only be able to do this once!

### Solve:

Here we go, the final task. Let's go get that challenge coin.
